%% Note: you can also specify any of the following options:
%%  logo: put a University of Edinburgh logo onto the title page
%%  frontabs: put the abstract onto the title page
%%  deptreport: produce a title page that fits into a Computer Science
%%      departmental cover [not sure if this actually works]
%%  singlespacing, fullspacing, doublespacing: choose line spacing
%%  oneside, twoside: specify a one-sided or two-sided thesis
%%  10pt, 11pt, 12pt: choose a font size
%%  centrechapter, leftchapter, rightchapter: alignment of chapter headings

%% For an MPhil thesis -- also needs an institute
% \documentclass[mphil,ianc]{infthesis}

%% MSc by Research, which also needs an institute

\abstract{%
    In this project, an Android application with the purpose of helping users with early detection of skin cancer is developed. The concept is based around enabling users to easily compare photos of their skin spots, providing them with the tools to detect changes in appearance which could indicate a potentially dangerous skin lesion.
    
    The project focuses on the successful completion of the main phases in the mobile app development process. These stages include design, implementation, user testing, evaluation, and eventually deployment to the Google Play Store. Part of the project also involves developing and launching a website to provide users with further guidance on how to use the application.
